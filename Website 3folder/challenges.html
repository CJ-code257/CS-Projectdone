        <section>
            <h2>Education Crisis in the Philippines</h2>
            <p>The Philippines faces unique educational challenges that have been amplified by recent events and systemic issues:</p>
            
            <h3>Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic</h3>
            <p>The pandemic caused unprecedented learning losses, with students losing an average of 1.5 years of education. Many students, particularly in rural areas, had no access to remote learning during school closures, creating gaps that persist today.</p>

            <h3>Infrastructure Deficiencies</h3>
            <p>Many schools operate with overcrowded classrooms, insufficient furniture, inadequate sanitation facilities, and limited access to electricity. These conditions make it difficult for students to focus and learn effectively.</p>

            <h3>Language Barriers</h3>
            <p>The multi-lingual nature of the Philippines creates challenges, as students often learn in languages different from their mother tongue, affecting comprehension and academic performance.</p>
