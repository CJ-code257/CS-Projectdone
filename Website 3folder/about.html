                <h2>About EqualEd</h2>
                <p>EqualEd: Education Unlocked began in 2020 by passionate teachers and community organizers who saw up close the catastrophic effects of educational disparity amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. What began as a community, volunteer-based initiative in Davao City bridging gaps for struggling learners to engage in online learning turned into a national movement committed to tearing down walls to quality education. Our founders, themselves a team of former teachers, social workers, and technologists, shared one vision: that all Filipino children, regardless of where they are from and no matter their socioeconomic background, deserve to receive quality education.</p>
                <p>EqualEd now deploys its programs in various provinces of the Philippines via mobile learning centers, digital literacy, and community education. We do not view education as simply a path to academic achievement—it's about empowering individuals to transform their communities and create a more equitable society. Our blended approach combines tried-and-true teaching methods with innovative technology solutions so that we engage learners where they are and assist them based on what works best for them.</p>

                <h3>Christoff John D. Reonal</h3>
                <p><strong>Founder & Executive Director</strong></p>
                
                <p>Christoff is a firm believer in educational parity who knows firsthand the disadvantages that limited learning materials bring. Growing up and schooling in Davao, he saw firsthand how economic status and place can really affect a child's capacity to receive quality education. With a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Christoff chose that he would spend his career applying technology in the service of a larger good. His web development experience and extensive presence in the Philippine education system most qualify him to head EqualEd's work of extending quality education to all Filipino children, especially those in marginalized sectors.</p>
